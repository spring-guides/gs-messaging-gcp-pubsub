This guide walks you through the process of exchanging messages between different parts of a
program, or different programs, using
http://docs.spring.io/spring-integration/reference/htmlsingle/#overview-endpoints-channeladapter[Spring Integration channel adapters]
and
https://cloud.google.com/pubsub/[Google Cloud Pub/Sub] as the underlying message exchange mechanism.

== What you'll build

A https://spring.io/guides/gs/spring-boot/[Spring Boot] web application that sends messages to
itself and processes those messages.


== What you'll need

== Add required dependencies

At the time of writing, the Spring Cloud GCP libraries are in Beta stage.
As such, they are published to Spring Milestones Maven repository.

Add the following to your `pom.xml` file if you're using Maven:

```
<dependencies>
    ...
    <dependency>
        <groupId>org.springframework.cloud</groupId>
        <artifactId>spring-cloud-gcp-starter-pubsub</artifactId>
    </dependency>

    <dependency>
        <groupId>org.springframework.integration</groupId>
        <artifactId>spring-integration-core</artifactId>
    </dependency>
    ...
</dependencies>

<repositories>
    ...
    <repository>
        <id>spring-milestones</id>
        <name>Spring Milestones</name>
        <url>https://repo.spring.io/libs-milestone</url>
    </repository>
    ...
</repositories>
```

Or, if you're using Gradle:

```
repositories {
    ...
    maven {
        url "http://repo.spring.io/libs-milestone"
    }
    ...
}

dependencies {
    ...
    compile("org.springframework.cloud:spring-cloud-gcp-starter-pubsub:1.0.0.M2")
    compile("org.springframework.integration:spring-integration-core")
    ...
}
```

If you're using Maven, you are also strongly encouraged to use the Spring Cloud GCP bill of
materials to control the versions of your dependencies:

```
<properties>
    ...
    <spring-cloud-gcp.version>1.0.0.M2</spring-cloud-gcp.version>
    ...
</properties>

<dependencyManagement>
    <dependencies>
       ...
        <dependency>
            <groupId>org.springframework.cloud</groupId>
            <artifactId>spring-cloud-gcp-dependencies</artifactId>
            <version>${spring-cloud-gcp.version}</version>
            <type>pom</type>
            <scope>import</scope>
        </dependency>
        ...
    </dependencies>
</dependencyManagement>
```

== Set up Google Cloud Pub/Sub environment

You will need a topic and a subscription to send and receive messages from Google Cloud Pub/Sub.
You can create them in the https://console.cloud.google.com/cloudpubsub[Google Cloud Console]
or, programatically, with the `PubSubAdmin` class.

For this exercise, create a topic called "testTopic" and a subscription for that topic called
"testSubscription".

== Create application files

You'll need a class to include the channel adapter and messaging configuration. Create a
PubSubApplication class with the @SpringBootApplication header, as is typical with a Spring Boot
application.

`src/main/java/hello/PubSubApplication.java`
[source, java]
----
@SpringBootApplication
public class PubSubApplication {

  public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException {
    SpringApplication.run(PubSubApplication.class, args);
  }

}
----

Additionally, since you're building a web application, create a WebAppController class to separate
between the controller and configuration logic.

`src/main/java/hello/WebAppController.java`
[source, java]
----
@RestController
public class WebAppController {
}
----

We're still missing two files for HTML and properties.

`src/main/resources/static/index.html`
[source, java]
----
include::/complete/src/main/resources/static/index.html[]
----

`src/main/resources/application.properties`
[source, java]
----
include::/complete/src/main/resources/application.properties[]
----

The Spring Cloud GCP Core Boot starter can auto-configure these two properties and make them
optional. Properties from the properties file always have precedence over the Spring Boot
configuration. The Spring Cloud GCP Core Boot starter is bundled with the Spring Cloud GCP
Pub/Sub Boot starter.

The GCP project ID is auto-configured from the `GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT` environment variable, among
https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/google-cloud-java/blob/master/google-cloud-core/src/main/java/com/google/cloud/ServiceOptions.java#L287[several other sources].
The OAuth2 credentials are auto-configured from the
https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/application-default-credentials[GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS]
environment variable. If the https://cloud.google.com/sdk/[Google Cloud SDK] is installed, this
environment variable is easily configured by running the `gcloud auth application-default login`
command in the same process of the app, or a parent one.

== Create an inbound channel adapter

An inbound channel adapter listens to messages from a Google Cloud Pub/Sub subscription and sends
them to a Spring channel in an application.

Instantiating an inbound channel adapter requires a `PubSubOperations` instance and the name of an
existing subscription.
`PubSubOperations` is Spring's abstraction to subscribe to Google Cloud Pub/Sub topics.
The Spring Cloud GCP Pub/Sub Boot starter provides an auto-configured `PubSubOperations` instance
which you can simply inject as a method argument.

`src/main/java/hello/PubSubApplication.java`
[source,java]
----
include::/complete/src/main/java/hello/PubSubApplication.java[tag=messageChannelAdapter]
----

The message acknowledgement mode is set in the adapter to automatic, by default. This behaviour
may be overridden, as shown in the example.

After the channel adapter is instantiated, an output channel where the adapter sends the received
messages to must be configured.

`src/main/java/hello/PubSubApplication.java`
[source,java]
----
include::/complete/src/main/java/hello/PubSubApplication.java[tag=pubsubInputChannel]
----

Attached to an inbound channel is a service activator which is used to process incoming messages.

`src/main/java/hello/PubSubApplication.java`
[source,java]
----
include::/complete/src/main/java/hello/PubSubApplication.java[tag=messageReceiver]
----

The `ServiceActivator` input channel name (e.g., `"pubsubInputChannel"`) must match the input
channel method name. Whenever a new message arrives to that channel, it is processed by the returned
`MessageHandler`.

In this example, the message is processed simply by logging its body and acknowledging it. In manual
acknowledgement, a message is acknowledged using the `AckReplyConsumer` object, which is sent in
the message headers.

== Create an outbound channel adapter

An outbound channel adapter listens to new messages from a Spring channel and publishes them to a
Google Cloud Pub/Sub topic.

Instantiating an outbound channel adapter requires a `PubSubOperations` and the name of an existing
topic.
`PubSubOperations` is Spring's abstraction to publish messages to Google Cloud Pub/Sub topics.
The Spring Cloud GCP Pub/Sub Boot starter provides an auto-configured `PubSubOperations` instance.

`src/main/java/hello/PubSubApplication.java`
[source,java]
----
include::/complete/src/main/java/hello/PubSubApplication.java[tag=messageSender]
----

You can use a `MessageGateway` to write messages to a channel and publish them to Google Cloud
Pub/Sub.

`src/main/java/hello/PubSubApplication.java`
[source,java]
----
include::/complete/src/main/java/hello/PubSubApplication.java[tag=messageGateway]
----

From this code, Spring auto-generates an object that can then be autowired into a private field in
the application.

`src/main/java/hello/WebAppController.java`
[source,java]
----
include::/complete/src/main/java/hello/WebAppController.java[tag=autowireGateway]
----

== Add controller logic

Add logic to your controller that lets you write to a Spring channel:

`src/main/java/hello/WebAppController.java`
[source,java]
----
include::complete/src/main/java/hello/WebAppController.java[]
----

== Authentication

Your application must be authenticated either via the GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS environment
variable or the `spring.cloud.gcp.credentials.location` property.

If you have the https://cloud.google.com/sdk/[Google Cloud SDK] installed, you can log in
with your user account using the `gcloud auth application-default login` command.

Alternatively, you can download a service account credentials file from the
https://cloud.google.com/console[Google Cloud Console] and point the
`spring.cloud.gcp.credentials.location` property in the `application.properties` file to it.

As a
https://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/3.2.x/spring-framework-reference/html/resources.html[Spring Resource],
the `spring.cloud.gcp.credentials.location` can also be obtained
from places other than the file system, like a URL, classpath, etc.

== Make the application executable

Although it is possible to package this service as a traditional link:/understanding/WAR[WAR] file
for deployment to an external application server, the simpler approach demonstrated below creates a
standalone application.
You package everything in a single, executable JAR file, driven by a Java `main()` method.
Also, you use Spring's support for embedding the link:/understanding/Tomcat[Tomcat] servlet
container as the HTTP runtime, instead of deploying to an external instance.

include::https://raw.githubusercontent.com/spring-guides/getting-started-macros/master/spring-boot-application.adoc[]

include::https://raw.githubusercontent.com/spring-guides/getting-started-macros/master/build_an_executable_jar_subhead.adoc[]

include::https://raw.githubusercontent.com/spring-guides/getting-started-macros/master/build_an_executable_jar_with_both.adoc[]


Logging output is displayed. The service should be up and running within a few seconds.


== Test the application

Now that the application is running, you can test it. Open http://localhost:8080, type a message
in the input text box, press the "Publish!" button and verify that the message was correctly logged
in your process terminal window.

== Summary

Congratulations! You've just developed a Spring application that exchanges messages using Spring
Integration GCP Pub/Sub channel adapters!
